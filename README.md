# Particle Physics Analysis using Machine Learning

This repository combines projects that apply machine learning techniques to analyze high-energy physics events, focusing on classifying and predicting jet counts using datasets from the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) experiment.

---

## Overview

The primary objectives of this repository are:

1. **Jet Count Prediction**: Predict the number of jets in a particle collision event using physics-inspired features derived from CMS Open Data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Perform EDA on the dataset 'Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge'.
3. **Event Classification**: Classify particle collision events to distinguish between signal and background events.

By leveraging machine learning models, we aim to explore the feasibility of predicting jet counts and classifying events using kinematic variables.

## Dataset Description

The datasets contain information from particle collisions with key features such as:

- `Run`, `Lumi`, `Event`: Identifiers for each collision event.
- `MR`, `Rsq`: Razor kinematic variables estimating event mass scale and energy flow.
- `E1`, `Px1`, `Py1`, `Pz1`: Four-vector of the **leading megajet**.
- `E2`, `Px2`, `Py2`, `Pz2`: Four-vector of the **subleading megajet**.
- `HT`: Scalar sum of transverse momentum of all jets.
- `MET`: Missing transverse energy.
- `nJets`: Target variable â€” number of jets with transverse momentum > 40 GeV.
- `nBJets`: Number of **b-tagged** jets.

The other dataset is not added due to privacy reasons. Visit [Kaggle]{https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/higgs-boson} for the dataset.
